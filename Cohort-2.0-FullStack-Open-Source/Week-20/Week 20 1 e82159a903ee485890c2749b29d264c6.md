# Week 20.1

# Orientation Class For 1-100

This lecture served as an orientation for the next half of the cohort. We have officially finished the syllabus for the 0-1 section and will now be moving to the 1-100 section. In this lecture, Harkirat discussed the best practices to follow while progressing through the 1-100 section.

## Key Points

1. The classes in the 1-100 section are expected to be much easier compared to the 0-1 section of the cohort.
2. The 0-1 section covered the fundamentals and implementation, while the 1-100 section deals more with senior engineer-level, high-level concepts, which are beneficial to know when negotiating job offers.
3. We will mostly be dealing with block diagrams, system design, and the architecture side of software engineering in this section.
4. You don't need to attend live sessions; you can skip them and watch the recordings at your own pace from the [app.100xdevs.com](http://app.100xdevs.com) website.
5. Don't be lured into starting the 1-100 section prematurely. Ensure that you have strong foundations in the 0-1 syllabus before moving to this part.
