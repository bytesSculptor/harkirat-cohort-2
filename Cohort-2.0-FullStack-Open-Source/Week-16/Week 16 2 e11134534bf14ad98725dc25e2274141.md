# Week 16.2

In this lecture, Harkirat covers adding new pages to `apps/web`, exploring `turbo.json` and `caching in Turborepo`, integrating a `Node.js app`, and creating a `shared common module` for frontend and backend apps within the monorepo.

# Exploring `apps/web`

Sure, let's explore the `apps/web` directory and understand how it utilizes components from the `packages/ui` module.

### **1] Dependencies**

As mentioned, `apps/web` is a simple Next.js application. However, it leverages UI components from the `packages/ui` module, which is a shared UI library within the monorepo.

### **2] Exploring package.json**

In the `package.json` file of the `apps/web` directory, you'll notice that `@repo/ui` is listed as a dependency:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@repo/ui": "*",
    "next": "^14.1.1",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  }
}
```

The `"@repo/ui": "workspace:*"` entry indicates that the `apps/web` application depends on the `packages/ui` package within the same monorepo workspace. This allows the `apps/web` application to import and use the UI components defined in the `packages/ui` module.

### **3] Exploring page.tsx**

The `page.tsx` file is a Next.js page component that demonstrates the usage of the `Button` component from the `packages/ui` module.

Here's an example of how the `Button` component might be imported and used in the `page.tsx` file:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@repo/ui/button';
import styles from "./page/module.css";

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Web App</h1>
      
      <Button appName="Web" className={styles.button}>
        Click me
      </Button>
      
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example:

- The `Button` component is imported from `@repo/ui/button`, which corresponds to the `packages/ui/src/button.tsx` file defined in the `exports` field of the `packages/ui` package.
- The `Button` component is used within the `HomePage` component, passing in the required props:
    - `appName="Web"`: This prop is used to personalize the alert message displayed when the button is clicked.
    - `className={styles.button}`: This prop applies imported styles to the button using Tailwind CSS classes.
    - The content `Click me` is passed as the `children` prop, which will be rendered inside the button.

By importing and using the `Button` component from the `packages/ui` module, the `apps/web` application can leverage the shared UI components without duplicating code or maintaining separate implementations.

### **Shared Components**

The same `Button` component can be used by other applications within the monorepo, such as the `apps/docs` website. This promotes code reuse and consistency across different parts of the project.

For example, in the `apps/docs` application, the `Button` component can be imported and used in a similar manner:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@repo/ui/button';

export default function DocsPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Documentation</h1>
      <Button appName="Docs" className="bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
        Read More
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this case, the `Button` component is imported from the same `packages/ui` module, but with different prop values (e.g., `appName="Docs"` and different styles).

# Adding a New Page

**1. Create a new component in `packages/ui/src`**

First, we need to create a new file `admin.tsx` inside the `packages/ui/src` directory. This file will contain the implementation of the `Admin` component.

```jsx
// packages/ui/src/admin.tsx
"use client";

export const Admin = () => {
  return <h1>hi from admin component</h1>;
};
```

In this example, we're exporting a simple functional component called `Admin` that renders an `<h1>` element with the text "hi from admin component".

**2. Add the component to exports in `packages/ui/package.json`**

Next, we need to add the `Admin` component to the `exports` field in the `packages/ui/package.json` file, so that it can be imported and used by other applications within the monorepo.

```json
{
  "exports": {
    "./button": "src/button.tsx",
    "./card": "src/card.tsx",
    "./code": "src/code.tsx",
    "./admin": "src/admin.tsx"
  }
}
```

By adding `"./admin": "src/admin.tsx"` to the `exports` field, we're exposing the `Admin` component as part of the public API of the `packages/ui` module.

**3. Create `apps/web/app/admin/page.tsx`**

Now, we can create a new page in the `apps/web` application that will use the `Admin` component from the `packages/ui` module.

Create a new file `apps/web/app/admin/page.tsx` with the following content:

```jsx
import { Admin } from "@repo/ui/admin";

export default function AdminPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Admin Page</h1>
      <Admin />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this file, we're importing the `Admin` component from `@repo/ui/admin` (which maps to the `packages/ui/src/admin.tsx` file) and using it within the `AdminPage` component.

**4. Run the development server**

To see the new page in action, you can run the development server by executing the following command in the root directory or the `apps/web` directory:

```
npm run dev
```

Once the development server is running, you can visit `http://localhost:3000/admin` in your web browser to see the new `AdminPage` component, which includes the `Admin` component from the `packages/ui` module.

**Using the `packages/ui/turbo/generators`**

Turborepo provides a code generation feature that can automate the process of creating new components and files. You can use the `npx gen react-component` command to generate a new React component within the `packages/ui` module.

When you run `npx gen react-component`, Turborepo will prompt you for the component name and other details. It will then generate the necessary files and update the `package.json` file with the new component export.

By leveraging the code generation feature, you can streamline the process of creating new components and ensure consistency across the monorepo.

> In summary, we've added a new page to the `apps/web` Next.js website by creating a new `Admin` component in the `packages/ui` module, exposing it through the `exports` field in the `package.json` file, and using it within the `AdminPage` component. Additionally, we've explored the code generation feature provided by Turborepo, which can further simplify the process of creating new components.

# Exploring `turbo.json`

The `turbo.json` file is a configuration file used by Turborepo to define the build pipeline and task dependencies within a monorepo. It plays a crucial role in orchestrating the execution of tasks across different packages and applications.

Here's an example of what a `turbo.json` file might look like:

```json
{
  "$schema": "<https://turborepo.org/schema.json>",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"],
      "outputs": []
    },
    "lint": {
      "dependsOn": ["^lint"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    }
  }
}
```

Let's break down the different sections of this file:

1. **Schema Definition**: The `"$schema"` field specifies the URL of the JSON schema that defines the structure and properties of the `turbo.json` file. This helps with validation and autocompletion in code editors.
2. **Pipeline**: The `"pipeline"` object defines the tasks that Turborepo can execute and their dependencies.
    - `"build"`: This task is responsible for building the packages and applications within the monorepo. The `"dependsOn": ["^build"]` property specifies that this task depends on the `build` tasks of its dependencies (denoted by the `^` prefix). The `"outputs": ["dist/**"]` property indicates that the outputs of this task will be stored in the `dist` directory and its subdirectories.
    - `"test"`: This task is responsible for running tests. It `"dependsOn"` the `build` task, meaning that the tests will be executed after the packages and applications have been built.
    - `"lint"`: This task is responsible for linting the codebase. It `"dependsOn"` the `lint` tasks of its dependencies (denoted by `^lint`).
    - `"dev"`: This task is likely used for running the development server. The `"cache": false` property tells Turborepo not to cache the outputs of this task, as it is a long-running process. The `"persistent": true` property indicates that this task is a persistent, long-running process, and other tasks should not depend on it.

![Untitled](Week%2016%202%20e11134534bf14ad98725dc25e2274141/Untitled%201.png)

The `turbo.json` file allows you to define the tasks and their dependencies in a declarative way. Turborepo uses this information to optimize the execution of tasks, leveraging caching, parallelization, and dependency graph awareness.

For example, when you run `turbo build`, Turborepo will execute the `build` task for each package and application in the correct order, based on the defined dependencies. It will also cache the outputs of the `build` task, so that subsequent runs can reuse the cached outputs if the inputs haven't changed, resulting in faster build times.

Similarly, when you run `turbo test`, Turborepo will first execute the `build` task (if necessary), and then run the `test` task for each package and application that depends on the `build` task.

# Adding React Projects

**1. Navigate to the `apps` folder**

First, navigate to the `apps` folder within your Turborepo monorepo:

```
cd apps
```

**2. Create a fresh Vite app**

We'll use the `create-vite` command to create a new Vite-based React application:

```
npm create vite@latest
```

Follow the prompts to specify the project name, package manager (e.g., npm or pnpm), and other options. Once the project is created, navigate into the project directory.

**3. Update `package.json` to include `@repo/ui` as a dependency**

Open the `package.json` file in the newly created Vite app and add `@repo/ui` as a dependency:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@repo/ui": "*"
  }
}
```

This will allow your Vite app to import and use components from the `packages/ui` module.

**4. Run `npm install` in the root folder**

Navigate back to the root folder of your Turborepo monorepo and run `npm install` to install the new dependencies:

```bash
cd ..
npm install
```

**5. Run `npm run dev`**

To start the development server for your Turborepo monorepo, including the new Vite app, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development servers for all the applications and packages within your monorepo.

**6. Import and use components from `@repo/ui`**

In your Vite app, you can now import and use components from the `packages/ui` module. For example, in your `App.jsx` file, you can import and render the `Button` component:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@repo/ui/button';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Vite App</h1>
      <Button appName="Vite">Click me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**7. Add a `turbo.json` to the Vite app folder**

To ensure that Turborepo correctly handles the build outputs for your Vite app, you can create a `turbo.json` file in the Vite app's directory. This file will override the `outputs` object for this specific workspace.

Create a `turbo.json` file in your Vite app's directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "extends": ["//"],
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration tells Turborepo to treat the `dist` directory and its subdirectories as the build outputs for your Vite app.

> By following these steps, you've successfully added a new React project (Vite app) to your Turborepo monorepo and integrated it with the shared `packages/ui` module. You can now develop and build your Vite app alongside the other applications and packages within the monorepo, leveraging the shared UI components and benefiting from Turborepo's caching and optimization features.

# Caching in Turborepo

One of the key features that make Turborepo fast and efficient is its caching mechanism. Turborepo intelligently caches the outputs of tasks (such as build, test, and lint) across different builds, allowing it to skip redundant work and reuse cached results when the inputs haven't changed.

### **Caching in Action**

To observe caching in action, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root directory of your Turborepo project.
2. Run the `npm run build` command to build your project:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will execute the `build` task for all packages and applications within your monorepo, generating the necessary build artifacts.

1. Run the `npm run build` command again:

```bash
npm run build
```

You'll notice that the second time you run the `build` command, it executes almost instantly. This is because Turborepo has cached the outputs of the `build` task from the previous run, and since the inputs (source files, dependencies, etc.) haven't changed, it can reuse the cached results instead of rebuilding everything from scratch.

### **Exploring the Cache**

Turborepo stores its cache artifacts in the `node_modules/.cache/turbo` directory within your project. You can explore this directory to see the cached files and their contents.

1. Navigate to the `node_modules/.cache/turbo` directory:

```bash
cd node_modules/.cache/turbo
```

1. List the contents of the directory:

```bash
ls
```

You'll see a list of files with names that look like hashes (e.g., `78awdk123.tar.zst`). These are the cached artifacts for different tasks.

1. To inspect the contents of a cached artifact, you can use the `tar` command with the `unzstd` compression program:

```bash
tar --use-compress-program=unzstd -xvf 78awdk123.tar.zst
```

This command will extract the contents of the `78awdk123.tar.zst` file, allowing you to explore the cached outputs, including build artifacts and log files.

### **How Caching Works**

Turborepo's caching mechanism works by calculating a hash based on the inputs of a task (source files, dependencies, environment variables, etc.). When you run a task, Turborepo checks if a cached artifact with the same hash exists. If it does, Turborepo skips executing the task and instead replays the cached outputs, including logs and build artifacts.

If the inputs have changed since the last run, Turborepo will detect a cache miss and execute the task from scratch, generating new outputs and caching them for future use.

By leveraging caching, Turborepo can significantly reduce build times, especially in large monorepos with many packages and applications. It avoids redundant work and allows developers to iterate quickly, as only the parts of the codebase that have changed need to be rebuilt.

### **Clearing the Cache**

If you ever need to clear Turborepo's cache, you can simply delete the `node_modules/.cache/turbo` directory:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.cache/turbo
```

This will force Turborepo to rebuild everything from scratch on the next run, as there will be no cached artifacts available.

# Adding a Node.js App

**1. Create the `apps/backend` directory**

First, create a new directory for your Node.js app within the `apps` folder:

```bash
mkdir apps/backend
cd apps/backend
```

**2. Initialize an empty TypeScript repository**

Initialize a new npm package and set up TypeScript:

```bash
npm init -y
npx tsc --init
```

**3. Use the base TypeScript configuration**

Replace the contents of the generated `tsconfig.json` file with the following configuration, which extends the base TypeScript configuration from the `@repo/typescript-config` package:

```json
{
  "extends": "@repo/typescript-config/base.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["ES2015"],
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules"],
  "include": ["."]
}
```

**4. Install dependencies**

Install the required dependencies for your Node.js app, such as Express:

```
npm install express @types/express
```

**5. Create the `src/index.ts` file**

Create a new file `src/index.ts` and add a basic Express server:

```tsx
import express from "express";

const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    message: "hello world"
  });
});
```

**6. Update the `turbo.json` file**

In the `apps/backend` directory, create a `turbo.json` file to configure the build outputs for your Node.js app:

```json
{
  "extends": ["//"],
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    }
  }
}
```

**7. Install esbuild**

Install the `esbuild` package, which will be used to build your Node.js app:

```bash
npm install esbuild
```

**8. Add the build script to `package.json`**

In the `apps/backend/package.json` file, add a `build` script that uses `esbuild` to build your Node.js app:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "esbuild src/index.ts --platform=node --bundle --outdir=dist"
  }
}
```

**9. Build and run the Node.js app**

You can now build and run your Node.js app using Turborepo:

```bash
# Build the app
npm run build

# Run the app
node dist/index.js
```

You should see the "hello world" message when you visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

**Integrating with Turborepo**

To integrate your Node.js app with the rest of your Turborepo monorepo, you can update the root `turbo.json` file to include the `apps/backend` workspace:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

Now, when you run `npm run build` or `npm run dev` from the root directory, Turborepo will also build or start your Node.js app alongside the other applications and packages in your monorepo.

> By following these steps, you've successfully added a Node.js app to your Turborepo monorepo and configured it to use `esbuild` for building. You can now develop and build your Node.js app alongside the other applications and packages within the monorepo, leveraging the shared configurations and benefiting from Turborepo's caching and optimization features.

# **Adding a com**mon module

**1. Navigate to the `packages` directory**

First, navigate to the `packages` directory within your Turborepo monorepo:

```bash
cd packages
```

**2. Create the `common` directory**

Create a new directory for the common module:

```bash
mkdir common
cd common

```

**3. Initialize an empty Node.js project**

Initialize a new npm package and set up TypeScript:

```bash
npm init -y
npx tsc --init

```

**4. Change the package name to `@repo/common`**

Open the `package.json` file and update the `name` field to `@repo/common`:

```bash
{
  "name": "@repo/common",
  // ...
}

```

**5. Export something from `src/index.ts`**

Create a new file `src/index.ts` and export a simple value or function:

```tsx
export const NUMBER = 1;
```

**6. Add `@repo/common` as a dependency in other applications**

In the `package.json` files of the applications that need to use the `@repo/common` module (e.g., Next.js app, React app, Node.js app), add `@repo/common` as a dependency:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@repo/common": "*"
  }
}
```

**7. Import and use the exported value or function**

In the applications that depend on `@repo/common`, you can now import and use the exported value or function. For example, in a Next.js page component:

```jsx
import { NUMBER } from '@repo/common';

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home Page</h1>
      <p>The number is: {NUMBER}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**8. Run `npm install` in the root folder**

Navigate back to the root folder of your Turborepo monorepo and run `npm install` to install the new dependencies:

```
cd ../..
npm install
```

**9. Run the applications**

You can now run the applications that use the `@repo/common` module, and you should see the expected behavior. For example, if you run the Next.js app with `npm run dev`, you should see the value of `NUMBER` displayed on the home page.

By following these steps, you've successfully added a common module (`@repo/common`) to your Turborepo monorepo. This module can be shared and used by both frontend and backend applications within the monorepo, promoting code reuse and consistency.

> The common module can contain shared utilities, constants, types, or any other code that needs to be accessible across multiple applications. You can continue to expand the functionality of the `@repo/common` module as needed, and it will be automatically available to all applications that depend on it.
